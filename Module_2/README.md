The insights from this module support demand analysis, pricing strategy, and channel performance evaluation.

## Key Focus Areas
- Measurement of occupancy and revenue efficiency

- Comparison of Direct vs OTA booking contributions
- High-level KPI monitoring with interactive drilldowns

## Outcome
By the end of this module, users will be able to clearly understand how occupancy and pricing impact overall revenue, identify peak and low-demand periods, and assess the effectiveness of different booking channels through intuitive dashboards and KPIs.
